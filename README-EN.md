# Python 100 Exercises
We'll go through 100 Python exercises in a knock format.

These exercises are inspired by the problems from this [URL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh0qRBHbnVs&list=WL&index=4), so please take a look.

### Preface
As a beginner, I wanted to start programming and was told that Python is a good place to start, so I decided to begin. This serves as my memo and I hope that by sharing it publicly, it will keep me motivated.

### Environment Setup
I'm using a Mac, and will be performing the exercises in VSCode and JupyterLab.
I'll use Homebrew for installations, so if you don't have it, please run the following command in the terminal to install it:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
Next, install Python and JupyterLab on your Mac:
```
brew install python
pip install jupyterlab
```
Start JupyterLab:
```
jupyter lab
```
With that, JupyterLab will be installed and launched on your Mac. Your browser will automatically open, and you can use JupyterLab by accessing "http://localhost:8888/lab".
